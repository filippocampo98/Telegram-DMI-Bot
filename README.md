### Setting up a local istance
If you want to test the bot by creating your personal istance, follow this steps:
* **Clone this repository** or download it as zip.
* **Copy config/token.conf.dist into "token.conf" and write your telegram bot token here.** (If you don't have a token, message Telegram's [@BotFather](http://telegram.me/Botfather) to create a bot and get a token for it)
* **Send a message to your bot** on Telegram, even '/start' will do. If you don't, you could get an error
* Copy the file data/DMI_DB.db.dist into data/DMI_DB.db to enable the database sqlite
